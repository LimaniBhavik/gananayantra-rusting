Perfect. Final stretch now — this is the **last strategic step before publishing**.

# 🧭 VERSIONING — STEP-BY-STEP (REPLIT-SAFE)

We’ll define a **clear semantic versioning strategy** so:

* users trust the crate
* you don’t lock yourself in
* future growth is painless

No code changes yet. This is **decision + light config only**.

---

## 🎯 GOAL OF THIS STEP

By the end, you will know:

* what `0.1.0` really means
* when to bump **minor vs patch vs major**
* how to safely add new calculators
* how to avoid breaking users

---

# ✅ STEP 1: UNDERSTAND YOUR CURRENT STATE (IMPORTANT)

Your crate is currently:

```toml
version = "0.1.0"
```

This communicates to the Rust ecosystem:

> ⚠️ **API is usable but not yet guaranteed stable**

That is **exactly correct** for where you are.

---

# ✅ STEP 2: ADOPT OFFICIAL SEMVER RULES (RUST STYLE)

Rust follows **Semantic Versioning**, with one important nuance for `0.x`.

### 🔢 Version format

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

---

## 🟡 While version is `0.x.y`

During `0.x`:

| Change type               | Version bump  |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| Bug fix                   | PATCH (0.1.1) |
| Add new calculator        | MINOR (0.2.0) |
| Change function signature | MINOR (0.2.0) |
| Remove or rename API      | MINOR (0.2.0) |

👉 Breaking changes are **allowed** in `0.x`
👉 But you should still be disciplined

---

## 🟢 After `1.0.0`

Once you release `1.0.0`:

| Change type                  | Version bump  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Bug fix                      | PATCH (1.0.1) |
| Backward-compatible addition | MINOR (1.1.0) |
| Breaking change              | MAJOR (2.0.0) |

---

# ✅ STEP 3: DEFINE YOUR VERSIONING POLICY (WRITE THIS DOWN)

This is the **policy I strongly recommend** for `gananayantra-rusting`:

### 📌 Policy

* Stay in **0.x** while:

  * adding new industries
  * refining API ergonomics
  * improving docs
* Treat **MINOR bumps seriously**
* Do **not** remove public functions without a version bump
* No silent breaking changes

You can even add this later to README:

```md
## Versioning
This crate follows semantic versioning.
Until 1.0.0, breaking changes may occur in minor releases.
```

---

# ✅ STEP 4: REPLIT-SAFE CHECK (NO CODE CHANGE)

### Prompt to Replit

```
Review the current public API of gananayantra-rusting.

Goal:
- Confirm that version 0.1.0 accurately represents the API maturity
- Identify any obvious API instability risks
- Do NOT change any code or version numbers

Report findings only.
```

This is **safe** and won’t trigger large diffs.

---

# ✅ STEP 5: DECIDE NEXT VERSION (MENTAL DECISION)

You now have two good options:

### Option A (Recommended)

👉 **Publish as `0.1.0`**

* Honest
* Conservative
* Standard practice

### Option B

👉 `0.2.0` if you plan immediate changes after publish

📌 **Recommendation:** Publish **0.1.0**

---

# 🧠 WHAT THIS STEP ACHIEVES

After VERSIONING:

✔ You won’t paint yourself into a corner
✔ Users understand expectations
✔ You can add calculators freely
✔ You’re aligned with Rust ecosystem norms

This is what separates **hobby crates** from **maintained crates**.

---

# 🚀 NEXT STEP (FINAL DECISION)

Reply with **one word**:

* **`PUBLISH`** → final publish checklist + exact command
* **`STOP`** → full summary of architecture & next roadmap

You’re now **ready to ship** 🚢
